XSS Bareback
===========

This plugin disables the escape-by-default behaviour for applications using Rails 3.0 or later.

There is almost __no good reason__ for you to be using this plugin, it's provided for educational purposes only.  You should view the XSS protection in 3.0 as the web equivalent of [ASLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization "
Address space layout randomization"), turning it off is basically never worth the risk it implies.

If you still want to do this, __you have been warned__.
